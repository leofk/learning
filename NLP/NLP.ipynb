    "1. Using pre-trained embeddings is a really powerful tool that we can leverage to make predictions on difficult data (free-form text data in particular), but we should be careful about using the embeddings as well since they may inadvertently have biases and stereotypes embedded in them, sometimes even without are knowledge. So it's important to always keep in mind how the results we generate from our machine learning models are being generated and identify whether or not they could be caused by biases in our data or in our pre-trained embeddings in this case.\n",
    "2. Such a model could be harmful in the real world because it teaches data models to reduce gender minorities to superficial characteristics - not only can this harm both society's perception on gender minorities and their self-perception, but it reinforces the idea that gender minorities deserve to be paid less as they are taken less seriously than white male leaders even though they are contributing the same work and may have the same qualifications, and it hence affects their livelihood.  With Machine Learning and NLP we have the opportunity to systemically break gender stereotypes by producing unbiased results, rather than reinforcing society's gender laws from regular day life. "

    "1. The difference is that using CountVectorizer (bag-of-words) simply counts the instances of a words in the provided text, whereas average-embedding we find complex word vectors from the pretrained embeddings of spaCy and compute the average of these to represent the text data. \n",
    "2. Bag of words is a more interpretable representation compared to average embedding because it is kept in an english form and is therefore more readable/interpretable to humans. This is more interpretable than average embedding, where text data is represented by vectors.\n",
    "3. Yes, since embeddings are trained on the spaCy model's corpus. In this case the CountVectorizer strategy in general appears to perform marginally better, but we notice that average-embedding is less overfitting. Thus we can assume that there is benefit in that transfer learning would generalize better to unseen data. "

    "rubric={points:8}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you'll prepare the data for topic modeling using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). Preprocessing is a crucial step before training an LDA model and it markedly affects topic modeling results. So let's carry out preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Write code to carry out preprocessing of the \"text\" column in the dataframe above and store the preprocessed text in a new column called \"text_pp\" in the dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is no such thing as \"perfect\" preprocessing. You'll have to make your own judgments and decisions on which tokens are more informative and which ones are less informative for the given task. Some common text preprocessing steps for topic modeling are: \n",
    "- getting rid of slashes or other weird characters\n",
    "- sentence segmentation and tokenization      \n",
    "- getting rid of urls and email addresses\n",
    "- getting rid of other fairly unique tokens which are not going to help us in topic modeling  \n",
    "- excluding stopwords and punctuation \n",
    "- lemmatization        \n",
    "\n",
    "You might have to go back and forth between the preprocessing and topic modeling and interpretation steps in the next exercises. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Check out [these available attributes](https://spacy.io/api/token#attributes) for `token` in spaCy which might help you with preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "> You can also get rid of words with specific POS tags. [Here](https://spacy.io/api/annotation/#pos-en) is the list of part-of-speech tags used in spaCy. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that preprocessing the corpus might take some time. So here are a couple of suggestions: 1) During the debugging phase, work on a smaller subset of the data. 2) Once you're done with the preprocessing part, you might want to save the preprocessed data so that you don't run the preprocessing part every time you run the notebook. \n"
